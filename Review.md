### Review
We have made a baseline database schema:
![Database Schema](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shenke93/LinkedForever/Ke/diagrams/dbschema.png)

We have made some web pages.
We use hibernate and have written some persistent objects and some of their functions.

#### Following tasks
    Further requirements analysis. We need a list of functions to realise.
    Using pattern DAO (Data Access Object)
    Using Spring Framework (with/without?) others frameworks(Struts, Hibernate)
    Determine environment of development (IDE, framework, Database, Building Tools etc)
